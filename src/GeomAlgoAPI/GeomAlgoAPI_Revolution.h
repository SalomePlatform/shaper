/// revolution will be bounded by the infinite planes taken from the faces.
/// \n If the bounding plane was specified with the angle then this plane will be rotated around
/// the axis to the value of the angle.
/// \n Note that algorithm return only one solid object. So in case when after cutting with bounding
/// planes algorithm got more than one solid it will return the closest to the center of mass of
/// the base face.
