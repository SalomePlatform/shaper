/** Description: 
 *    Each constraint uses a set of parameters. In the SolveSpace library 
 *    these parameters are named "valA", "ptA", "ptB", "entityA", "entityB". 
 *    The "ptA" and "ptB" parameters represents a point in the constraint.
 *    The "entityA" and "entityB" represents any other object (and a point too).
 *    And the "valA" represents a real value.
 *
 *    The attributes below are named independent of the SolveSpace.
 *    Some of them may be unused. 
 *
 *    Also the list of possible attributes is provided to simplify assignment.
