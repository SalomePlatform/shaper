 * \brief Operation manager. Servers to manipulate to the workshop operations. Contains a stack
 * of started operations. In simple case, if only one operation is started, the stack contains
 * one operation. It is possible for some kind of operations to start them above already
 * started one. In that case, the previous active operation becomes suspended, a new one - active.
 * The new operation is added to the top of the stack. Then it is finished, it is removed from
 * the stack and the previous operation is activated.
