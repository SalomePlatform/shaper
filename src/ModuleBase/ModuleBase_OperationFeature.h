 * \class ModuleBase_OperationFeature
 * \ingroup GUI
 * \brief Base class for all operations
 *
 *  Base class for all operations. If you perform an action it is reasonable to create
 *  operation intended for this. This is a base class for all operations which provides
 *  mechanism for correct starting operations, starting operations above already started
 *  ones, committing operations and so on. To create own operation it is reasonable to
 *  inherit it from this class and redefines virtual methods to provide own behavior
 *  Main virtual methods are
 *  - virtual bool      isReadyToStart();
 *  - virtual void      startOperation();
 *  - virtual void      abortOperation();
 *  - virtual void      commitOperation();
