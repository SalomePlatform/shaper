Introduction to SHAPER
======================

SHAPER module of SALOME is destined for:

- import and export of geometrical models in IGES, BREP, STEP and XAO formats;
- parametric construction of geometrical objects using a wide range of functions:

  - creation of complex 2D sections using :ref:`sketchPlugin` with consequent extrusion or revolution (see :ref:`featuresPlugin`);
  - construction of model using primitives defined in :ref:`primitivesPlugin`;
  - usage of Boolean operations (see :ref:`featuresPlugin`);

- viewing geometrical objects in the OCC viewer;
- transformation of geometrical objects using various algorithms.

It is possible to easily set :ref:`parameter_usage` predefined to be used as arguments when objects are created.

SHAPER module preferences are described in the :ref:`preferences` section of SALOME Help.

Almost all SHAPER  module functionalities are accessible via Python Interface.

SHAPER module works with one study containing several documents:

- partset
- one or several parts.

Only one document can be active. In complicated models partset consists of several parts. Parts in partset may be copied, positioned relatively to each other, or simply translated.

A new study contains only a partset with 7 default constructions, which cannot be deleted:

- one point **Origin** coinciding with the origin of the coordinate system;
- three axes **OX**, **OY**, **OZ**  coinciding with coordinate axes;
- three planes **YOZ**, **XOZ**, **XOY**  coinciding with coordinate planes.

Only  points, axis, planes (see  :ref:`constructionPlugin`) and sketches (see  :ref:`sketchPlugin`) can be added into Partset to be used in any part later.
:ref:`parameter_usage` can be used both in Partset and any Part.

A new Part can be created as described in :ref:`partPlugin`.

Double click or pop-up menu can be used to activate existing document.

Application desktop
-------------------

The main window of the application consists of the following components:

- :ref:`main_menu`;
- :ref:`doc_windows`;
- :ref:`viewer`;
- :ref:`toolbar`;
- status bar.

   :align: center

   Main menu

Main menu includes standard Salome items:

- File;
- Edit;
- View;
- Tools;
- Window;
- Help;

and items specific for SHAPER module:

- Part (see :ref:`partPlugin`);
- Sketch (see :ref:`sketchPlugin`);
- Construction (see :ref:`constructionPlugin`);
- Build (see :ref:`buildPlugin`);
- Primitives (see :ref:`primitivesPlugin`);
- Features (see :ref:`featuresPlugin`);
- Macros.

 .. _toolbar:

SHAPER toolbar
--------------

Application toolbar contains:

- standard toolbar;
- modules toolbar;
- SHAPER toolbar.

.. figure:: /images/toolbar.png
   :align: center

   Toolbars

SHAPER toolbar duplicates the main menu and  provides access to all commands of the application.

SHAPER toolbar is separated into sections:

- Part;
- Movement;
- Measurement;
- Sketch;
- Construction;
- Build;
- Primitives;
- GDML;
- Features;
- Boolean;
- Collections;
- Fillet;
- Macros.

Visibility of SHAPER toolbar sections is managed using *View -> Toolbar* :ref:`main_menu` item or toolbar pop-up menu.

.. _doc_windows:

Dock windows
------------

Standard dock windows are:

- :ref:`object_browser`
- :ref:`inspection_panel`
- :ref:`hidefaces_panel`
- :ref:`python console`
- :ref:`property_panel`

Dock windows can be placed in three dock areas using drag-and-drop:

- left,
- right,
- bottom.

By default Object browser window is placed at the left dock area, Inspection panel at the right dock area and Python console at the bottom dock area of the main window.

Property Panel is hidden.

Property Panel is shown on operation start in left dock area of the main window by default.

If Object browser is shown at the same side then they will be tabbed.

Each dock window can be closed using **Cross** window button and opened again using a corresponding command from *View - Windows* :ref:`main_menu` or alternatively using pop-up menu.

.. figure:: /images/popup_menu.png

.. _object_browser:

Object browser
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Object browser contains all documents created in the current study.

Each document includes standard branches where created objects are placed.

Documents with branches are shown in Tree View.

.. figure:: /images/object_browser.png
   :align: center

   **Object browser**: Partset active

Partset includes three branches:

- Parameters;
- Constructions;
- Features

Part includes the following branches:

- Parameters;
- Constructions;
- Results;
- Fields;
- Groups;
- Features.

New part contains only 3 empty branches:

- Parameters;
- Constructions;
- Results.

Features are placed one after another in the active document with default names and their results are placed into the corresponding branch.

Examples of default names assigned automatically for :ref:`box_feature` are:

* **Box_1**, **Box_2**, ... for Feature;
* **Box_1_1**, **Box_2_1**, ... for Result.

Note, that a default branch is added into Tree View when the first feature of this type is created.

Note, that the result used in feature as argument is removed.

This child result can be restored using **Recover** feature.

Each feature, result, construction, group, field, parameter can be renamed using *Rename* pop-up menu command (hotkey "F2").

   :align: center

   **Construction** pop-up menu

.. figure:: /images/popup_menu_object_browser_group.png
   :align: center

   **Group** pop-up menu

The order of features can be changed using *Move to the end* and *Move to the end and split* pop-up menu commands. They work only for Group features. The selected group or several groups will be moved to the end of features list. The *Move to the end and split* also splits the resulting group in several groups: one group per one selection.

Folders can be used to arrange long Tree View for features.

.. figure:: /images/object_browser_folder.png
   :align: center

   **Object browser** with folder Dome: Part_1 active

*Insert a folder before* pop-up menu command creates a new empty folder before the selected feature. The folder can be renamed.

Features placed after/before the created folder can be moved into the folder using *Move into the previous folder* / *Move into the next folder* pop-up menu command.

This allows to decrease the length of feature list.

Features can be removed from the folder using *Move out before the folder* / *Move out after the folder* pop-up menu command.

*Clean history* pop-up menu command looks for features that do not participate in other features.

**Clean history** dialog box shows a list of unused features. After confirmation by click **Yes** button unused features are removed.

.. figure:: /images/clean_history.png
   :align: center

   **Clean history** dialog box

*Select result* and *Select parent feature* pop-up menu commands help to navigate along Tree View.

A feature and its result can be deleted using *Delete* pop-up menu command.

Note that all features using the removed feature and their results will be removed simultaneously.

**Delete feature** dialog box shows the list of features to be removed. After confirmation by click **Yes** button all these features are removed.

.. figure:: /images/delete_feature.png

.. _inspection_panel:

Inspection panel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inspection panel provides the list of types and quantities of all topological entities, composing the selected result, construction or feature.

.. figure:: /images/inspection_panel.png
   :align: center

   **Inspection panel** for default Box

**Object** displays name of the selected result, construction  or feature.

**Type** characterizes the whole shape.

The information about Point, Axis or Edge  additionally shows coordinates of point / end points.

.. figure:: /images/inspection_panel_line.png
   :align: center

   **Inspection panel** for Axis

The information about  Plane, Face additionally shows coordinates of center point and direction of normal.

.. figure:: /images/inspection_panel_face.png
   :align: center

   **Inspection panel** for Face

The shapes information, equal to the provided Inspection panel information on the shape is accessible inpython API by usage of **shapeInfo** command:

 | *from salome.shaper import geom*
 | *geom.shapeInfo(vertex)*
 | *==> ('Vertex', 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)*


.. _hidefaces_panel:

Hide Faces panel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Hide Faces** panel makes it possible to temporarily hide faces of any displayed object. **Hide Faces** panel looks like following:

.. figure:: /images/hide_faces_panel.png
   :align: center

   **Hide Faces** panel

- If this panel is activated it "listens" to the user selection.
- If a face is selected then its name will be shown in the panel's list and hidden in the viewer.
- If the user wants to display a hidden result body again (by a show operation) then the faces of this result body will be removed from Hide Faces list and the visibility of all referenced faces will be restored.

Instead of hiding the faces, it is also possible to make them transparent. For this purpose the **"Transparent"** check-box can be used. The value of the transparency can be changed under the **Visualization** tab of the **Preferences** dialog box.
Closing the **Hide Faces** panel restores the visibility state of all objects. If it is necessary to deactivete the **Hide Faces** panel (preserving the current display state) then the user has to press the **"Esc"** button.

.. _python console:

Python console
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python console interpreters Python commands entered manually.

In particular, it is possible to load the python script:

*execfile(r"/dn48/newgeom/data/example.py")*

Pop-up menu gives the possibility to:

- Copy the selected text to clipboard;
- Paste the text from clipboard to Python console ;
- Clear Python console;
- Dump commands from console into the specified file;
- Start/Stop writing log into the specified file.

.. _viewer:

Viewer
------

The application supports one instance of OCC 3D viewer and is able to show only one 3D space.

This 3D space can be represented in several view windows. New view window can be created using **Clone view** button in viewer toolbar.

Each view windows shows its own point of view on the 3D scene.

This point of view can be modified using viewer commands: **Panning**, **Zooming**, **Scaling**, etc.

.. figure:: /images/2_viewers.png
   :align: center

   Two view windows

The viewer is able to show direction of edges of objects.

.. figure:: /images/edges_directions.png
   :align: center

   Showing the edges direction

The description of OCC 3D Viewer architecture and functionality is provided in GUI module user's guide in chapter **OCC 3D Viewer**.

.. _parameter_usage:

Parameters
----------

Model parametrization can be done using parameters.

A parameter can be created in the active partset or part by:

- :ref:`parameter`;
- :ref:`parameters`;
- :ref:`parameter_expression`.

Any argument in features can be defined as parameter or expression containing parameters.

The list of features using parameters is given in **Parameters** dialog box:

 .. figure:: /images/parameters_feature.png
   :align: center

   Parameters dialog box

If a parameter value is changed, then all features where it is used are rebuilt.

A parameter name should be unique in the active document.

However, partset and part can have parameters with the same name. If parameter names in Partset and Part are identical, then Part parameter has a higher priority and its value will be used in the features of this part.

In contrast to features (see :ref:`object_browser`), there is an additional option when parameters are deleted.

.. figure:: /images/delete_parameter.png
   :align: center

   Delete parameter

After clicking **Replace** button, the selected parameter is removed but its parent parameters and features are not removed. The deleted parameter is replaced by its value.

.. _parameter_expression:

Create parameter on fly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Parameter can be created during feature creation simply by writing *variable=expression* in any editbox.

After feature validation a new parameter with the given name **variable** and value equal to the evaluated expression appears in object browser under **Parameters** in the active partset or part.

.. _preferences:
